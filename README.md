# ls-on-rightclick
windows 11 registry file to add an option to the context menu that runs POSIX shell `ls` in the current folder. 

## how to use
press shift+rightclick to see all options, then click "Open PowerShell and Run ls".<br>
This works both while a folder is highlighted (will show the inside of the folder), and if clicking anywhere in the background (will show the current folder). Hope this can be useful :)
